similarity_check: |
  Compare these two texts and determine if they belong to the same cluster.
  Texts are in the same cluster only if they discuss the same core topic/concept. 
  First identify the core topic/concept, then check if the texts discuss the same topic/concept.

  Text 1: "{text1}"
  Text 2: "{text2}"

  {domain_knowledge}

  Response format -- provide the core topic of the two texts and finish with 'Answer: <yes/no>' 
  yes, if they are in the same cluster, no otherwise:

  - Core topic/concept:
      - text 1: <core topic of text 1>
      - text 2: <core topic of text 2>
  - Answer: <yes/no>

cluster_summary: |
  {domain_knowledge}Analyze these related texts and provide a structured summary of the core concepts,
  patterns, and hypotheses that emerge. Consider domain-specific knowledge in your analysis.

  Cluster texts:
  - {joined_texts}

  Format your response as:

  Core Concepts:
  - <key concept 1>
  - <key concept 2>

  Patterns:
  - <observed pattern 1>
  - <observed pattern 2>

  Hypotheses:
  - <potential hypothesis 1>
  - <potential hypothesis 2>

  Summary: <concise summary of the cluster's theme>

cluster_assignment: |
  Considering the following cluster summary and domain-specific knowledge, check if the given text can be a member of the cluster.

  {domain_knowledge}

  Cluster summary: "{cluster_summary}"
  Text: "{outlier_text}"

  Does the text can belong to this cluster, considering the cluster summary and domain-specific knowledge?

  Format your response as:

  - Core topic/concept: <core topic of the outlier text, using domain-specific knowledge>
  - Answer: <yes/no>
